        <h3 class="card-title">Why Web Dev?</h3>
        <p class="card-description">By accident, I grew to enjoy programming. In other words, it was never something I imagined myself doing. In fact, I was more of a music person. Regardless, I've been dabbling in web design and development for the past 3 years.</p>
